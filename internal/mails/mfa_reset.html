<h1>MFA Device Reset Request</h1>
<p>We received a request to reset the two-factor authentication (MFA) device for your Safebucket account. Your
    verification code is:</p>
<div class="verification-code">
    <span>{{.Secret}}</span>
</div>
<p>Use this code to confirm the MFA reset. After confirmation, your current authenticator device will be removed and
    you can set up a new one.</p>
<table class="body-action" align="center" width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" role="presentation">
    <tr>
        <td align="center">
            <a class="f-fallback button" href="{{.ChallengeURL}}" target="_blank">Reset MFA Device</a>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>
<p>Or copy and paste this URL into your browser: <a href="{{.ChallengeURL}}">{{.ChallengeURL}}</a></p>
<p>If you did not request an MFA reset, please secure your account immediately by changing your password. Someone may
    have access to your credentials.</p>
<p>For security reasons, this verification code will expire after a certain period.</p>
<p>Thank you,<br/>The Safebucket team</p>
